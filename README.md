# Project Title
Project Fahari Air

## Overview
I will undertake data cleansing, imputation, analysis, and visualisation for this project using the CRISP-DM approach in order to produce insights for a business stakeholder.

## Business Understanding
To diversify its portfolio, your organisation is growing into Aviation industry. They want to buy and run aeroplanes for both individual and commercial use, but they have no idea what the possible risks associated with aviation are. Your job is to figure out which aeroplane the corporation should start this new venture with the least amount of danger. Next, in order to assist the head of the new aviation division in making an aircraft purchase decision, you need to convert your research findings into practical insights.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

The data source is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

Below is a simple description of the Aviation data

Number.of.Engines         82817.593096

## Conclusion
1. The business should invest in planes with one or two Engines
2. Considering the total number of the uninjured Boieng comes out as the better recomended Make of a plane to inverst with >70000 uninjured, on the other hand Boieng had 700 fatalities.
3. From the data analyzed there is clear that situations resulting in no or few fatalities are more common than those resulting in numerous fatalities. Implying fatal injuries are rare  therefore a viable business endeavour as its low risk.
